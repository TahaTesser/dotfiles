## .zshrc

This is my custom zsh configuration.

- Set oh-my-zsh as default shell
- Set apple theme
- Add plugins
- Add Flutter aliases and editors aliases
- Add JAVA environment variables
- Add Android environment variables
- Add Flutter environment variables
- Add Node environment variables
- Add API Keys for OpenAI and Anthropic

## setup.sh

This script will install Flutter and set up the environment for development in GitHub Codespaces.

- Install zsh if not present
- Install Oh My Zsh if not present
- Install Flutter
- Set up Flutter environment
- Disable Windows, macOS, Android, Linux and web configurations. As I'm using GitHub Codespaces only for running Flutter tests and not for development.
